            Early decisions save the most money. We manage site investigations, due diligence, and concept design to set each project on the right path. 
            Our team coordinates with architects, engineers, and municipal agencies so plans are complete and permits are secured before work begins.

          <p>
            During construction, we represent the owner's interests at all times. 
            We actively monitor quality control, verify that safety procedures are followed, and ensure any deficiencies are corrected quickly. 
            Our team tracks progress against the schedule, reviews contractor pay applications, and provides leadership with clear monthly updates.
