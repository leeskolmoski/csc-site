        <h2>Keys to a Successful Project</h2>
        <p>
          Every project begins with clarity. We work with you to define scope, schedule, quality standards, and budget from the start. 
          By doing the heavy lifting in pre-construction—reviewing drawings, refining specifications, and building on paper first—we minimize surprises 
          and reduce costly change orders. The result is a project that stays on budget and on track.

        <h2>Our Project Management Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach is disciplined but practical. We use complete, accurate contracts to keep procurement smooth. 
          We plan 60–90 days ahead, hold teams accountable, and monitor quality, cost, and schedule at every step so you get exactly what you pay for.
