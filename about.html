        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          CSC was founded by experienced industry leaders who saw the need for an owner-focused partner in the construction process. Our role is to simplify complexity, advocate for the client, and ensure projects are delivered on time, on budget, and to specification.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We free up leadership to focus on operations and future sites, while CSC manages the details — concept to completion — with uncompromising attention to safety and quality.
