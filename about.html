        <h2>Keys to a Successful Project</h2>
        <p>
          Every project begins with clarity. We work with you to define scope, schedule, quality standards, and budget from the start. 
          By doing the heavy lifting in pre-construction, reviewing drawings, refining specifications, and building on paper first, we minimize surprises 
          and reduce costly change orders. The result is a project that stays on budget and on track.

        <h2>Our Project Management Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach is disciplined but practical. We use complete, accurate contracts to keep procurement smooth. 
          We plan 60 to 90 days ahead, hold teams accountable, and monitor quality, cost, and schedule at every step so you get exactly what you pay for.

    <!-- GLOBAL SAFETY & COMPLIANCE -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Global Safety and Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          Safety and compliance are at the heart of every project we manage. U.S. construction standards are some of the most rigorous in the world. 
          We help our clients meet and exceed those expectations, from worker safety programs to regulatory approvals.
        </p>
        <p>
          For international companies entering the U.S. market, we guide teams through permitting, OSHA requirements, 
          and government compliance to prevent delays and keep operations running smoothly. 
          For projects outside the U.S., we bring that same commitment to quality and safety. 
          We collaborate with local partners and respect local regulations while delivering a consistently high standard of execution.
